# Preparing the Project
I started off by creating the index.html file and also installed SCSS into the project.

I used SCSS/SASS for this projec because it will allow me to write and manage my CSS quickly and efficiently.

# HTML
First I created the HTML for the entire page.

I have formatted the HTML into separate sections in order to make it clean and readable.

Containers were added in order to center the layout on desktop.

# SASS/CSS
SASS is used in this project as it allows for more legible code when working within nested elements.

Normalize CSS was added so the design will look consistent in all the browsers.

Roboto font was imported in the SASS.

The colors used on this project are listed as variables, so they can be easily changed if required.

Flex box was used to layout the page.

Media queries were used in order to create the responsive mobile layout.
